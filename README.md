Have been learning web development for about 5 months now so here are some 
early examples of HTML, CSS and jQuery that extend from the previous repos.

The overall design is weak, this is mainly an experiment with responsive design and implementation.
At this stage no thought has been put into optimization, SEO or much else outside of core dev. 

Any input is welcome!

There are 4 different branches showing different layouts:

master - As close to a finished website for now. Much cleaner than other ideas, favicon introduced
	and smaller images.

idea1 - Trialing a entrance screen and instead of the 'masonry' effect I looked at displaying images 
	as a traditional gallery, playing with border effects and bigger images. Also buttons instead
	of normal links.

css_show_overflow - An idea to get around having all images the same height and then show the overflow
		    on hover. Kind of fun, but ultimately ugly.

new_lightbox - This is the initial branch I used to trial a different lighbox plugin which i kept.
	       Decided to keep this branch as it contains a general thought process despite having
	       having other design ideas I decided against.

Cheers,
Sim.
